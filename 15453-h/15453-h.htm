            dear old pal, I'll be bound,</p>

            <p>As hantiquities isn't my 'obby, and ruins don't

            picteresk cops;</p>

            <p>Big markee and a range of old 'en-coops, sports,
            niggers, a smart local band,</p>

            <p>Cottage gardemn', cheese, roosters, and races! Rum

            managed might pay.)</p>

            <p>Mysterious Minstrels with masks on, a bleating

            a-hour each day,</p>

            <p>Four six&mdash;foot posts stuck in the ground with a
            tape run around&mdash;them's the "props,"</p>

            <p>The gent he stands slap in the middle, and tries to

            <p>And the pair as counts most wins the prize. They are
            timed by a hegg-boiler. There!</p>

            <p>It <i>wos</i> all a pantermime, CHARLIE, to see 'ow

            pardner went pink and flounced off.</p>

            <p>He gurgled away like a babe with a pap-bottle,

            <p>Wy, there's thirty-two Springs in the Bog
            Field&mdash;a place like a graveyard gone

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>But I reckon my "Douche" is now due. Doctor BLACK's

        <p><i>Miss Golightly</i> (<i>the Friend of the Family, and
        to whom Sir Percy (the elder) has proposed</i>). "OF COURSE
        I'M AWFULLY OBLIGED, SIR PERCY&mdash;BUT, SAY NOW, DON'T

    <p>MR. CHAUNCEY DEPEW, the well-known American lawyer, wonders
    why on earth the British Government has not long ago given Home
    Rule to Ireland. He encourages Mr. G.'s Ministry to do their
    best in this direction, and chaunce-y it. We're always
    delighted to welcome Mr. CHAUNCEY DEPEW in England, so let him
    come over with a Depewtation to Mr. G. on the subject.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>EQUESTRIAN FRUIT.&mdash;At the Horticultural Show the
    Baroness BURDETT-COUTTS exhibited a "Cob of ADAM's Early
    Maize." No particulars are given. Was it 14'1 and a
    weight-carrier? Being ADAM's, it must be about the oldest in
    the world. "Maize" may be a misprint for "Mews." Next time the
    Baroness must send a pear.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>PROBABLE DEDUCTION.&mdash;A pertinacious Salvation Army
    Captain was worrying a Scotch farmer, whom he had met in the
    train, with perpetual inquiries as to whether "he had been born
    again of Water and the Spirit?" At last, McSANDY replied,
    "Aweel, I dinna reetly ken how that may be, but my good old
    feyther and mither took their toddy releegiously every nicht,

    <h3>THE AUSTRO-GERMAN OFFICER'S VADE-MECUM.</h3>

    <p><i>Q.</i> You have heard of the Ride from Berlin to Vienna,
    and <i>vice versâ</i>?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> Yes; and of the mishaps that befell many of the
    competitors.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> You mean their horses?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> What applies to the one applies to the other.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> Some of the poor steeds died on the journey?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> I daresay&mdash;of course, it was hard work.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> And you have read that, even when the poor horses
    were fainting and refusing food, the riders still went on?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> Of course. The riders had magnificent pluck and
    nerve.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> What, to observe the anguish of their chargers
    without emotion?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> No! The idea! I mean they had pluck and nerve in
    spite of all discouragement to push on to the winning-post.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> And what do you think this breaking down of the
    horses proved?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> That, after all, the creatures were
    brutes&mdash;only brutes!</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> Does not the suffering of these brutes
    suggest&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> That the riders were brutes too?&mdash;Ah!</p>

    <p>IN EXCELSIS.&mdash;No better example of the methods employed
    by Vivisectionists could be given than was presented at the
    Church Congress last week, where in debate on this subject they
    were all engaged in cutting up one another. The Bishop of
    EDINBURGH, denouncing the morality of the Bishop of MANCHESTER
    and of Bishop BARRY, was a rare sight. His Lordship said that
    the morality of these two Bishops was "up in a balloon." Well,
    surely this is morality of the most elevated description. These
    Bishops are not "<i>in partibus</i>," but <i>in
    nubibus</i>.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>IN WATER COLOURS.&mdash;The East London Waterworks Company
    had a very successful meeting the other day. <i>Inter alia</i>
    the Chairman said, that "the Waltham Well is a complete
    success." <i>Ergo</i> let Well alone. That from this source
    they still supplied "36 gallons per head." The heads must be
    uncommonly hard to stand all this water on the brain. A
    dividend of eight per cent. is, after all, a very pleasant
    draught.</p>

        You will notice that the thistle is very abundant just

        that some years ago a vessel was wrecked on this part of

        productive; if you plant a sixpence, it will come up a
        shilling in no time. The cabbages on this island grow to an
        extraordinary height, frequently attaining twenty
        feet&mdash;(<i>outcry</i>)&mdash;yes, if you measure up one
        side, and down the other. (<i>They pass a couple of sheep

        The dark one is not black, only a little sunburnt. The
        house you see on that hill over there was formerly slept in
        by CHARLES THE SECOND. He left a pair of slippers behind
        him&mdash;which have since grown into top-boots. There you
        see the only windmill in this part of the
        island&mdash;there <i>used</i> to be three, but it was
        found there was not enough wind for them all. From here you
        have a clear view of the coast of France; and, when the
        wind is blowing in this direction, you have an excellent
        opportunity of acquiring the French accent in all its
        purity. (<i>This string of somewhat hoary chestnuts meets

    <h2>POLITICAL TRAINING.</h2>

    <p><i>Monday</i>.&mdash;Read Mr. CHAMBERLAIN's remarks on
    abstinence from bodily exercise. Sold my bicycle, and gave away
    all my rackets, bats, &amp;c. Resolved to follow the latest
    system. Shall doubtless, by these means, reach Mr. C.'s high
    position as a statesman and orator. Went out in a Bath-chair.
    Five minutes after starting, man said he was not accustomed to
    drag so heavy an invalid, and must rest a little. Tried a
    speech&mdash;my maiden one&mdash;on the Disadvantages of Bodily
    Exercise. He listened respectfully, and, when at last I had
    finished, said he quite agreed with me, and that the fare was
    seven shillings.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;Have decided that exercise in a
    Bath-chair is quite superfluous. Resolved to take exercise, for
    the future, in a hammock, just outside the garden-door. Must
    practise speech-making to the gardener. Good
    idea&mdash;Orchids. Asked him what he thought about the new
    Orchid. Miserable fool answered, "Awkud, zur? Dunno waht thaht
    be." I said that was "awkud," and had to laugh at the highly
    original side-splitter myself, as he never saw it.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;Must really give up this long walk
    to the garden-door. Shall never become a great statesman unless
    I do. Resolved to take exercise in arm-chair in library. The
    children's governess came in to fetch a book. Addressed her at
    some length on Free Education. Afterwards, thought this subject
    was somewhat ill-chosen, as her salary is so small.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;Really cannot stand this walking up
    and down stairs. Shall remain for the future in my bed-room and
    take exercise on sofa by fireside, as I feel chilly. Page came
    in with coals. Reminded me of Policy of Scuttle. Spoke of this
    at some length, and woke him up with difficulty when I had
    finished. Felt rather unwell.</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;Dressing and undressing is certainly
    needless fatigue, and evidently causes this headache and
    general seediness. Shall take exercise in bed. Felt worse.
    Female relatives anxious, and insist on medical attendance.
    Assured them I was following the best system, and answered
    their persistent demands by a short address on Home Rule.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday</i>.&mdash;Felt so bad at five this morning,
    that Doctor was fetched. Tried feebly to address him on the
    Eight Hours' Question, when he said he never had any time to
    think how long he worked. Explained my new system to him. He
    said I should myself want a new system to stand such a course
    of treatment. Then he pulled me out of bed, and insisted on my
    walking ten miles as soon as I was dressed. Felt much better.
    Shall abandon politics and become a farmer, having just heard
    of an infallible system for growing wheat profitably.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>THE "RESTORATION" PERIOD.&mdash;Will the Chairmen of the
    L.C. &amp; D. and the S.E. Lines unite their forces? After the
    meeting on this subject last week, Sir EDWARD will have lots of
    reason to listen to. But apart from every consideration of
    <i>mal de mer</i>, and "From Calais to Dover," as the poet
    sings "'Tis soonest over," there is not anywhere a better, and
    we, who have suffered as greatly as the much-enduring Ulysses,
    venture to assert not anywhere as good a luncheon as at the
    "Restauration" (well it deserves the title!) of the Calais
    Station. Every patriotic travelling Englishman must be
    delighted to think that some few centuries ago we gave up
    Calais. Had it been nowadays in English hands, why it might
    even now be possessed of a "Refreshment Room" no better
    than&mdash;any on our side of the Channel, for there is no
    necessity to particularise. From Dover to Calais is the
    shortest and best restorative'd route for the traveller,
    whether ill or well, at sea.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>MOTTOES for the new Lord MAYOR. "<i>Nil obstet</i>," "<i>Nil
    fortius</i>," and, from HORACE, "<i>Nil amplius oro</i>." This,
    in answer to thousands of correspondents, is our last word on
    the subject; so after this (except on the 9th of November), we
    say&mdash;<i>nil</i>.</p>

    <p>Had Sir ARTHUR written the music for <i>The Mountebanks</i>,
    and Sir BRIAN DE BOIS GILBERT the book of <i>Haddon Hall</i>,
    both might have been big successes So, however, it was not to
    be, and Sir ARTHUR chose this book by Mr. GRUNDY, which labours
    under the disadvantages of being original, and of not owing
    almost everything to a French source. It isn't every day of the
    week that Mr. GRUNDY tumbles upon <i>A Pair of Spectacles</i>
    in a volume of French plays. The period to which the very
    slight and uninteresting story of <i>Haddon Hall</i> belongs is
    just before the Restoration, but the dialogue of "the book" is
    spiced with modern slang, both "up to date" (the date being
    this present year of Grace, not sixteen hundred and sixty) and
    out of date. The "out-of-date" slang, which is, "<i>I've got
    'em on"</i>&mdash;alluding to the Scotchman's
    trousers&mdash;has by far the best of it, as it comes at the
    end of the piece, and enjoys the honour of having been set to
    music by the variously-gifted Composer: so that "<i>I've got
    'em on</i>," with its enthusiastically treble-encored whiskey
    fling, capitally danced by Miss NITA COLE as <i>Nance</i>, with
    Mr. DENNY as <i>The McCrankie</i>, may be considered as the
    real hit of the evening, having in itself about as much to do
    with whatever there is of the plot as would have the entrance
    of Mr. JOEY GRIMALDI, in full Clown's costume, with "Here we
    are again!" Of the music, as there was very little to catch and
    take away, one had to leave it. Of course this seriously comic
    or comically serious Opera is drawing&mdash;["<i>Music</i>,"
    observes Mr. WAGG, parenthetically, "cannot be
    <i>drawing</i>"]&mdash;and will continue to do so for some
    little time, long enough at all events to reimburse Mr. D'OYLY
    CARTE for his more than usually lavish outlay on the
    <i>mise-en-scène.</i></p>

    <p>In the Second Act, the mechanical change from the exterior
    of Haddon Hall to the interior, must be reckoned as among the
    most effective transformations ever seen on any stage. It would
    be still more so if the time occupied in making it were reduced
    one-half, and the storm in the orchestra, and the lightning
    seen through black gauze on stage were omitted. The lightning
    frightens nobody, only amuses a few, and in itself is no very
    great attraction. Even if these flashes were a very striking
    performance; no danger to the audience need be apprehended from
    it, seeing that Mr. CELLIER is in front as "Conductor." Perhaps
    Mr. D'OYLY CARTE, noticing that Mr. GRUNDY calls his piece "a
    light Opera," thought that, as it wasn't quite up to this
    description, it would be as well if the required "light'ning"
    were brought in somewhere, and so he introduced it here. If
    this be so, it is about the only flash of genius in the
    performance.</p>

    <h2>THOUGHTS&mdash;NOT WORTH A PENNY.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Fragment from the Burlesque-Romance of "No Cents; or,
    The New Criticism."</i>)</h4>

    <p>The Critic of the new cult visited a tailor's establishment,
    and was delighted with all he saw. There were coats, and vests,
    and other garments.</p>

    <p>"I make some fifty per cent. profit," said the proprietor of
    the establishment, stroking his moustache with a hand adorned
    with many a diamond ring. "Of course it causes some labour,
    thought, and time&mdash;but I get my money for my trouble."</p>

    <p>"And why not?" replied the Critic. "Are you not worth it? Do
    you not devote your energy to it? Must you not live?"</p>

    <p>And, having said this, the Reviewer visited another place of
    business. This time he had entered the office of a
    Stockbroker.</p>

    <p>"Of course it is rather anxious work sometimes," said the
    alternative representative of a bull and a bear. "But it pays
    in the long run. I manage to keep up a house in South
    Kensington, and a carriage and pair, out of my takings."</p>

    <p>"Again, why not?" responded the Critic. "You have a wife and
    family. Must you not live?" Then the Critic visited
    Cheesemongers, and Bankers, Solicitors, and Upholsterers. At
    last, he reached the modest abode of an Author.</p>

    <p>"Ah!" said he, in a tone of contempt; "you write books and
    plays! Why?</p>

    <p>"Why, to sell them," answered the Poet, in a faltering
    voice.</p>

    <p>"Sell them!" echoed the Critic, in tones of thunder. "What
    do you mean by that?"</p>

    <p>"Why, one must live!"</p>

    <p>"Nonsense! The universe can get on very well without anyone.
    You might be dispensed with; and, if it comes to that, so might
    I. Yes, I am not wanted."</p>

    <p>"Quite true!" murmured the Author; "indeed, you are
    not!"</p>

    <p>"And, after all, what <i>is</i> your work? Mere brain
    action! Anyone who could wield a pen could do it for you! And
    you expect to be paid, as if you were a tradesman&mdash;a
    Tailor or an Upholsterer!"</p>

    <p>"But am I not a man and a brother? Do I not get hungry, like
    anyone else? Have I not a wife and family?"</p>

    <p>"That is entirely beside the question," persisted the
    Critic. "All you have to consider are the claims of Art. Now,
    Art is not to be served by paid votaries."</p>

    <p>"Then I suppose am unworthy," replied the Author, mournfully
    shaking his head. Well, let us exchange places. You shall be
    the Author, and I will be the Critic."</p>

    <p>"Very sorry, my dear friend, but that is an unjust division.
    By that means you would receive all the money."</p>

    <p>"And why not? If I am to write, why am I not to be
    paid?"</p>

    <p>"Because it is beneath the dignity of an Author to write
    with a view to obtaining cash."</p>

    <p>"Indeed! Well, I am tired of work. You have nothing to do
    but criticise. Let us swap positions."</p>

    <p>"Are you mad?" shouted the Critic. "Why, I am fond of my
    work. You don't imagine I am going to give up my salary to you?
    Why, it would demoralise you. I know the drawback of the
    system." And the Author applied himself to the study of the New
    Criticism, and it seemed as great a mystery to him as ever.</p>

    <h2>LADY GAY'S SELECTIONS.</h2>

    <p class="author"><i>Mount Street, Grosvenor Square</i>.</p>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,</p>

    <p>Nothing but a keen sense of duty, coupled with the
    possession of <i>the</i> smartest thing in waterproof overcoats
    ever seen, would have tempted me to go racing last week; but
    the claims of Hurst Park were not to be denied, and my reward
    was, assisting at perhaps the most successful meeting ever held
    there&mdash;(the backers "went down" to a man, and so did the
    excellent lunch&mdash;so what more <i>could</i> you
    want?)&mdash;and, in addition, being told by at least twenty
    people, the name of the winner of the Cesarewitch!&mdash;they
    all named different horses, so that <i>one</i> is almost
    certain to be able to say next week, in that annoying tone of
    voice people adopt after a successful prophecy&mdash;(this does
    <i>not</i> apply to Just Prophets, who are notoriously modest
    in success)&mdash;"<i>There</i>! I <i>told</i> you it was a
    certainty for <i>Whiteface</i>!&mdash;couldn't
    lose!&mdash;<i>of course</i> you backed it, after what I told
    you!"&mdash;which of course was the very reason why you
    <i>hadn't</i> backed it; however&mdash;as he may really be able
    to tell you something on a future occasion, you put on a
    ghastly smile, and say&mdash;"Oh, yes&mdash;I had a trifle
    on&mdash;but my <i>money</i> was on <i>Blackfoot</i> before you
    told me&mdash;but it got me out!"&mdash;and it does "get you
    out" too, for nothing is more annoying than to be told you
    "ought to have won a good stake!"</p>

    <p>However, with regard to the great race next week, I am
    fortunately able to set aside all "information received,"
    because I have had <i>a dream</i>!&mdash;not one of the
    ordinary lobster-salad kind of racing-dreams one reads
    about&mdash;(naturally <i>I</i> should not have an inferior
    kind, having ordered in a stock of the "best selected," one to
    be taken every night at bed-time)&mdash;in which the dreamer
    only sees <i>one</i> horse&mdash;but a most complicated affair,
    from which it will be an easy task for anyone skilled in
    dream-lore to extract the winner!</p>

    <p>Well&mdash;I had been rather upset during the day, so to
    quiet my nerves, on reaching home, I took, before going to bed,
    just a little <i>Golden Drop</i> of <i>Brandy</i> as an
    <i>Insurance</i> against restlessness&mdash;went to sleep, and
    dreamt that my friends <i>Lady Villikins</i> and <i>Madame
    d'Albany</i>, with their maid <i>Helen Ware</i>, were attacked
    on their way from <i>Illsley</i> to <i>Weymouth</i>, by some
    <i>Dare Devil</i> of a <i>Circassian</i>, whose horse's hoofs
    rang in a <i>Metallic</i> manner on the road! They were rescued
    in the pass of <i>Ben Avon</i> by the gallant <i>Burnaby</i>,
    who after a long <i>Rigmarole</i>, squared their captor, <i>Roy
    Neil</i>, with a <i>Hanover Jack</i>, and acted as their
    <i>Pilot</i> to safe quarters at <i>Versailles</i>!
    There!&mdash;that was my dream&mdash;and I think it points most
    conclusively to the winner; and, anyone unable to pick the
    right one, need only back them <i>all</i>, and there you
    are!&mdash;or at least you <i>may</i> be. If they don't care to
    do this, they can avail themselves of my verse
    selection&mdash;which I did <i>not</i> dream&mdash;and which,
    therefore, is <i>quite</i> as reliable.</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p>Not the least interesting figure in the circle of <i>The
    Racing Life of Lord George Bentinck</i>, which Messrs.
    BLACKWOOD produce in a handsome volume, is that of JOHN KENT,
    who, under the editorship of Mr. FRANK LAWLEY, tells the story.
    KENT was trainer to Lord GEORGE during the period when, to
    quote the characteristic Disraelian phrase, his Lordship became
    "Lord Paramount of the Turf." It is forty-four years since Lord
    GEORGE was found lying dead on his face in the water-meadows
    near Welbeck Abbey. Yet KENT remembers all about him&mdash;his
    six feet of height, his long black frock-coat, his velvet
    waistcoat, his gold chain, and his "costly cream-coloured satin
    scarf of great length, knotted under his chin, with a gold pin
    stuck in it." These scarves cost twenty shillings a-piece, and
    it was one of Lord GEORGE's fancies never to wear one a second
    time. When he died whole drawersful of them were found, and
    honest JOHN KENT purchased half-a-dozen from his Lordship's
    valet, who seems to have kept his eye on them. Did he ever wear
    them on Sundays? My Baronite who has been reading the book
    trows not. JOHN KENT knows his place better than that, and when
    he goes the way that masters and servants tread together, the
    scarves will doubtless be found tucked away in <i>his</i> chest
    of drawers. My Baronite is not able to take the same lofty view
    of the defunct nobleman who played at politics and worked at
    racing as does his faithful old servitor. Lord GEORGE seems to
    have been, as the cabman observed of the late JOHN FORSTER, "a
    harbitery gent," kind to those who faithfully serve him (as one
    is kind to a useful hound), but relentless to any who offended
    him or crossed his path. Moreover, whilst, as his biographer
    devoutly says, he purified the turf, he was not, upon occasion,
    above fighting blacklegs with their own weapons. The book gives
    clear glimpses of men and times which, less than half a century
    dead, will never live again. It pleasantly testifies that,
    though no man may be a hero to his valet, Lord GEORGE BENTINCK
    remains one in the eyes of his trainer.</p>

    <p>The Baron not having read a three-volume novel for some
    considerable time, may safely affirm, instead of taking his
    oath, that Mrs. OLIPHANT's <i>The Cuckoo in the Nest</i> is one
    of the best he has come across for quite two months. It opens
    well, and if it drops a bit about the middle, there are all
    sorts of surprises yet in store for the reader, who, the Baron
    assures him or her, will be rewarded for his, or her,
    perseverance.</p>

    <p>The Baron begs to recommend the latest volume of the
    Whitefriars Library, called <i>King Zub</i>, by W.H. POLLOCK.
    <i>Zub</i> is a wise poodle, and the waggish tale of the dog
    gives the name to the collection. <i>The Fleeting Show</i> is
    quite on a par with <i>The Green Lady</i> in a former
    collection by the same author, and such other stories as <i>Sir
    Jocelyn's Cap</i> and <i>A Phantom Fish</i> will delight those
    who, like the Baron, love the mixture as before of the weird
    and the humorous. In the <i>Phantom Fish</i> there is much
    local dialect, and The Baron coming across the expression, "a
    proper bender," is inclined to ask if this is not
    Zummerzetsheer for, and only applicable to, a running hare? The
    Baron remembers the expression well, though 'tis years since he
    heard it, and owns to being uncertain as to whether it is not
    Devonian or Cornish. That he heard it applied to a hare
    apparent he is prepared to make oath and say; but he is not in
    the least prepared to assert that it is not generally applied
    as an expression of admiration for adroitness in avoiding
    pursuit. "Be that as it may, give me <i>King Zub</i> and the
    other stories, a good fire, a glass of spiritual comfort, a
    cosy chair, and a soothing pipe, and I am prepared to spend a
    pleasant evening," says</p>

    <h2>CONVERSATIONAL HINTS FOR YOUNG SHOOTERS.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's own Grouse in the Gun-room.</i>)</h4>

    <p>In our last (it is <i>Mr. Punch</i> who speaks), we
    indicated very briefly the conversational possibilities of the
    Gun. It must be observed, that this treatise makes no
    pretensions to be exhaustive. Something must, after all, be
    left to the ingenuity of the young shooter who desires to talk
    of sport. All that these hints profess, is to put him in the
    way of shining, if there is a certain amount of natural
    brightness to begin upon. The next subject will be&mdash;</p>

    <h3 class="sc">Cartridges.</h3>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:22%;">
        <a href="images/180-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/180-1.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>To a real talker, this subject offers an infinite variety of
    opportunities. First, you can begin to fight the battle of the
    powders, as thus:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"What powder are you shooting with this year, CHALMERS?"</p>

    <p>"Schultze."</p>

    <p>"How do you find it kill?"</p>

    <p>"Deadly&mdash;absolutely-deadly: best lot I've ever
    had."</p>

    <p>You need not say anything more now. The discussion will get
    along beautifully without you, for you will have drawn, (1),
    the man who very much prefers E.C., which he warrants to kill
    at a distance no other powder can attain to; (2), the man who
    uses E.C. or Schultze for his right barrel, and always puts a
    black-powder cartridge into his left; (3), the detester of
    innovations, who means to go on using the good old black-powder
    for both barrels as long as he lives; and (4), the man who is
    trying an entirely new patent powder, infinitely superior to
    anything else ever invented, and is willing to give everybody,
    not only the address of the maker, but half a dozen cartridges
    to try.</p>

    <p>You cannot make much of "charges" of powder. Good shots are
    dogmatic on the point, and ordinary shots don't bother their
    heads about it, trusting entirely to the man who sells them
    their cartridges. Still you might throw out, here and there, a
    few words about "drams" and "grains." Only, above all things,
    be careful <i>not</i> to mention drams in connection with
    anything but black powder, nor grains, except with reference to
    Schultze or E.C. A laboriously-acquired reputation as a
    scientific shot has been known to be ruined by a want of
    clearness on this important point.</p>

    <p>"Shot." Conversationally much more valuable than powder.
    "Very few people agree," says a well-known authority; "as to
    what is the best size of shot to use, and many forget that the
    charge which will suit one gun, and one description of game,
    will not do as well for another. Usually, one gun will shoot
    better one size of shot than will another, and we may safely
    say, that large bores shoot large shot better than do smaller
    bores." This last sentence has the beautiful ring of a profound
    truism. Lay it by for use, and bring it out with emphasis in
    the midst of such disagreement and forgetfulness as are here
    alluded to. "If a shooter is a good shot," says the same
    classic, "he may use No. 6 early in the season, and only for
    partridges&mdash;afterwards, nothing but No. 5. To the average
    shot, No. 6 throughout the season." This sounds dreadfully
    invidious. If a good shot cannot kill grouse with No. 6, how on
    earth is a merely average shot to do the trick? But, in these
    matters, the conversationalist finds his opportunity. Only they
    must not be pushed too far. There was once a party of genial,
    light-hearted friends, who went out shooting. Early in the day,
    slight differences of opinion made themselves observed with
    reference to the size of shot. Lunch found them still more or
    less good-tempered, but each obstinately determined not to give
    way even by a fraction on the point under discussion.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:23%;">
        <a href="images/180-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/180-2.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Afterwards they began again. The very dogs grew ashamed of
    the noise, and went home. That afternoon there was peace in the
    world of birds&mdash;at least, on that particular
    shooting&mdash;and the next morning saw the shooting-parties of
    England reduced by one, which had separated in different
    dog-carts, and various stages of high dudgeon, for the railway
    station. So, please to be very, very careful. Use the methods
    of compromise. If you find your friend obstinately pinned to
    No. 5, when you have declared a preference for No. 6, meet him
    half-way, or even profess to be converted by his arguments. Or
    tell him the anecdote about the Irishman, who always shot snipe
    with No. 4, because, "being such a little bird, bedad, you want
    a bigger shot to get at the beggar." You can then inform him
    how you yourself once did dreadful execution among driven
    grouse in a gale of wind with No. 8 shot, which you had brought
    out by mistake. You may object that you never, as a matter of
    fact, did this execution, never having even shot at all with
    No. 8. Tush! you are puling. If you are going to let a
    conscientious accuracy stand in your way like this, you had
    better become dumb when sporting talk is flying about. Of
    course you must not exaggerate too much. Only bumptious fools
    do that, and they are called liars for their pains. But a
    <i>little</i> exaggeration, just a <i>soupçon</i> of romance,
    does no one any harm, while it relieves the prosaic dullness of
    the ordinary anecdote. So, swallow your scruples, and</p>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
